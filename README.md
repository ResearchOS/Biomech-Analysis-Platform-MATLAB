# Biomech-Analysis-Platform
There are many software packages that perform various scientific data analyses, and many scientists write their own custom functions. However, there is no easy way for these custom functions or plethora of packages to interact with one another.

This "Biomechanical Analysis Platform" or "biomechOS" attempts to provide a common framework for data storage and management that does not impose a direction or method on the user. This methodology will allow scientists greater ease of use when incorporating others' code, greater flexibility with their code, etc.

This project is currently written and tested entirely in base MATLAB R2021b, no toolboxes are required.

To use this project, download the latest release [here](https://github.com/biomechOS/Biomech-Analysis-Platform/releases/latest). Place the entire folder in  your preferred location in your file system. Lastly, add the folder to the MATLAB path [see docs](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html).
