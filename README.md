# Biomech-Analysis-Platform
There are many software packages that perform various scientific data analyses, and many scientists write their own custom functions. However, there is no easy way for these custom functions or plethora of packages to interact with one another.

This "Biomechanical Analysis Platform" or "biomechOS" attempts to provide a common framework for data and code management that minimizes administrative requirements, while not imposing any method on the user. This framework will allow scientists greater ease of use when incorporating others' code, greater flexibility with their code, etc.

This project is currently written and tested entirely in base MATLAB R2021b, no toolboxes are required.

To use this project:
1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/biomechOS/Biomech-Analysis-Platform/releases/latest), or clone this repository to your computer.
2. Place the entire folder in your preferred location in your file system. 
3. Ensure that the folder is added to the MATLAB path ([see docs](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html)).
